We are in our second year with  Branch with  out any claims until now. Prior to this claim  every contact regarding any coverage change questions etc  have been exceptional profesional and very kind. This is way above average.                                        The claim was a total loss of vehicle and our claim was approved by the end of the second day and we received full payment within a few days.                                     According to acquaintances of ours this is unheard of in the insurance industry with other companies. My wife and I definitely give Branch a triple A and appreciate this company and their noticeable interest  in solving this claim.                                 We are excited to tell and have been telling our friends and acquaintances about Branch,4,"April 10, 2023"
Having an agent like James Duncan made the process simple. James was exceptionally professional and precise in every action that was required for both us and Branch. He kept us up to date every chance he got and was prompt on all responses to our questions concerns and needs. Thank you James for being there for us!,5,"March 27, 2023"
